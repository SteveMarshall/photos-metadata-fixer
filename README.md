# photos-metadata-fixer

A command line tool to ensure metadata in my
[Photos](https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/) library is correct,
because I think my migration from Aperture didn't go quite as smoothly
as I might have liked.

It uses flickr and Instagram as sources for “correct” metadata.

## Getting started

This project uses [GNU
Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Wildcard-Examples)
to automate build tasks. A number of automated commands are configured
in the `Makefile`. It doesn't have an Xcode project because I'm not using
Xcode for development yet.
